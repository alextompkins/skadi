This directory contains native libraries (.so) for all device architecture (x86, arm64, ...) for each OpenCV module (imgproc, imcodecs, highui, ...).
**IMPORTANT**: these libraries can increase a lot the overall size of the final APK.
So, if you want to fine tune and optimize to run in a minimal configuration, just delete the unused modules.
